        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="work-history">
            Previously, I worked in Asset and Real Estate Management, managing
            large client portfolios, ranging from industrial, residential, and
            sales. During that time, I worked as a Automotive Technician for
            approzimately three years.

          <li class="college-experience">
            This is not my first semester in college. I have been in college off
            and on since 2012 in which I was pursuing majors that I was good in
            but did not truly enjoy.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="hobbies">
            Currently, I am not in any sport or clubs but I am very interested
            in joining some clubs at Bristol, especially the STEM club.
            Regarding other extra activities, I am highly invested in playing
            video games, watching anime, and working on my car.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="coding-exp">
            I have roughly 1-2 years of experience coding. But, I really got
            into it this year when I joined a bootcamp called SheCodes. SheCodes
            was a great opportunity for me to see if this was something I was
            good at or truly enjoyed doing. So far, I am mid-level at the markup
            language, HTMl and the styling language, CSS. And, I am proficient
            in the programming languages, Javascript and Python.

        <h3>Goals and Plans</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My goal is to transfer to a four-year college to finish my career
            path towards a Automotive Cybersecurity Software Engineer. It is a
            particular niche but I am confident that I will make it there.
          </li>
          <li>
            I plan to move back down south as I enjoyed the culture and the
            automotive industry is larger with more opportunity.

      <div class="learning-style line-below" id="learning">
        <h3>My Learning Style</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After taking the quiz, I have learned that I am a predominantly
            Tactile, with some points in Auditory. This tells me that I prefer
            to be hands-on but I can also use listening tools to learn and study
            as well.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            From EducationPlanner.org for tactile, "Tactile learners prefer
            hands-on activities, physical movement, and learning through touch."
            Regarding auditory, "As an auditory learner, you grasp information
            best through hearing... Reading aloud helps you learn, and you might
            hum or talk when bored."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Based on what I read, it helped me realize that some of the little
            quirks, such as making noise while bored and fidgeting when I sit
            too long are traits of my learning style. Using what I learned, I
            will be utilizing the Pomodoro timer to maintain focus while also
            allowing me the time to get up and stretch when needed. As this
            class is quite hands on (as seen per this homework), I am already
            doing some of the things a tactile learner would do to help them
            learn more effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="time-management" id="time">
        <h3>Time Management</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After reading through some of the suggested links, I have learned
            that I need to invest in better calendar management. If I had this
            set up, this would allow me to know when assignments are due, and
            plan accordingly to read and study.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another tool I will implement is creating a better Activity/To-do
            log. One of the links mentioned creating a to-do list based on
            classes from Today's schedule, projects with a deadline, and when I
            get around to-it. This resonated with me as I struggle to determine
            what is a priority and what can wait to be completed.
